# lab-fwrd

It's my lab:

- to practice working with finite state machines
- also to experiment with a UI that works seamlessly with typescript code

## This Is Also a Mono Repo

```bash
./
├── fwrd/        # the core/API - pure typescript module that is runnable via deno
└── examples/    # example machines that uses `fwrd` module - written for deno
   └── runners/  # runnable via deno
```

## Run Examples

```bash
make
```
